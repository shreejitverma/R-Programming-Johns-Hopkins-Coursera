Control Structures - Part 1
===========================

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program, depending on runtime conditions. Common structures are:

* if, else: testing a condition
* for: execute a loop a fixed number of times
* while: execute a loop while a condition is true
* repeat: execute an infinite loop
* break: break the execution of a loop
* next: skip an iteration of a loop
* return: exit a function

Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but rather when writing functions or longer expressions.


if
--

This is a valid if/else structure.

	if(x > 3) {
		y <- 10
	} else {
		y <- 0
	}

So is this one.

	y <- if(x > 3) {
		10
	} else {
		0
	}


for
---

for loops take an iterator variable and assigns it successive values from a sequence or vector. For loops are most commonly used fro iterating over the elements of an object (list, vector, etc.)

	for(i in 1:10) {
		print(i)
	}

This loop takes the i variable and in each iteration of the loop gives it values 1, 2, 3, .., 10, and then exits.

These four loops have the same behavior.

	x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
	
	for(i in 1:4) {
		print(x[i])
	}
	
	for(i in seq_along(x)) {
		print(x[i])
	}

	for(letter in x) {
		print(letter)
	}
	
	for(i in 1:4) print(x[i])


Nested for loops
----------------

for loops can be nested.

	x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
	
	for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))) {
		for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
			print(x[i])
		}
	}
 Be careful with nesting though. Nesting beyond 2-3 levels is difficult to read/understand.
