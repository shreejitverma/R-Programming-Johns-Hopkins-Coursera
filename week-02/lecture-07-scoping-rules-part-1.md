Scoping Rules - Part 1
======================

Binding Values to a symbol
--------------------------

How does R know which value to assign to which symbol? When I type

	> lm <- function(x) { x * x }
	> lm
	function(x) { x * x }

How does R know what value to assign to the symbol lm? why doesn't it give it the value of lm that is in the stats package?

When R tries to bind a value to a symbol, it searches through a series of environments to find the appropriate value. When you are working on the command line and need to retrieve the value of an R object, the order is roughly:

1. Search the global environment for a symbol matching the one requested
2. Search the namespaces of each of the packages on the search list

The search list can be found using the search function

	> search()
	[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics"
	[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"
	[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base"

* The global environment or the user's workspace is always the first element of the search list and the base package is always the last
* The order of the packages on the search list matter!
* User's can configure which packages get loaded on startup so you cannot assume that there will be a set list of packages available
* When a user loads a package with library the namespace of that package gets put in position 2 of the search list (by default) and everything else gets shifted down the list
* Note that R has separate namespaces for functions and non-functions so it's possible to have an object named c and a function named c


Scoping rules
-------------

The scoping rules for R are the main feature that make it different from the original S language.

* The scoping rules determine how a value is associated with a free variable in a function
* R uses lexical scoping or static scoping. a common alternative is dynamic scoping
* Related to the scoping rules is how R uses the search list to bind a value to a symbol
* Lexical scoping turns out to be particularly useful for simplifying statistical computations


Lexical Scoping
---------------

Consider the following function.

	f <- function(x, y) {
		x^2 + y / z
	}

This function has 2 formal arguments x and y. In the body of the function there is another symbol z. In this case z is called a free variable. The scoping rules of a language determine how values are assigned to free variables. Free variables are not formal arguments and are not local variables (assigned inside the function body).

Lexical scoping in R means that the values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined.

What is an environment?

* An environment is a collection of (symbol, value) pairs _i.e._ x is a symbol and 3.14 might be its value
* Every environment has a parent environment; it is possible for an environment to have multiple "children"
* The only environment without a parent is the empty environment
* A function + an environment = a closure or function closure

Searching for the value for a free variable:

* If the value of a symbol is not found in the environment n which a function was defined, then the search is continued is the parent environment
* The search continues down the sequence of parent environments until we hit the top-level environment; this usually the global environment (workspace) or the namespace of a package
* After the top-level environment, the search continues down the search list until we hit the empty environment. If a value for a given symbol cannot be found once the empty environment is arrived at, then an error is thrown
