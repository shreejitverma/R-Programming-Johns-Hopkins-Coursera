Dates and Time
==============

R has developed a special representation of dates and times.

* Dates are represented by the Date class
* Times are represented by the POSIXct and POSIXlt class
* Dates are stored internally as the number of days since 1970-01-01
* Times are stored internally as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01


Dates in R
----------

Dates are represented by the Date and can be coerced from a character string using the as.Date() function.

	x <- as.Date("1970-01-01")
	x
	## [1] "1970-01-01"
	unclass(x)
	## [1] 0
	unclass(as.Date("1970-01-02"))
	## [1] 1


Times in R
----------

Times are represented using the POSIXct or the POSIXlt class.

* POSIXct is just a very large integer under the hood; it uses a useful class when you want to store times in something like a data frame
* POSIXlt is a list underneath and it stores a bunch of other useful information like the day of the week, day of the year, month, day of the month

There are a number of generic functions that work on the dates and times.

* weekdays: give the day of the week
* months: give the month name
* quarters: give the quarter number("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4")

Times can be coerced from a character string using the as.POSIXlt or as.POSIXct function.

	> x <- Sys,time()
	x
	## [1] "2013-01-24 22:04:14 EST"
	p <- as POSIXlt(x)
	names(unclassâ„—
	## [1] "sec" "min" "hour" "mday" "mon"
	## [6] "year" "wday" "yday" "isdst"
	p$sec
	## [1] 14.34

you can also use the POSIXct format:

	> x <- Sys.time()
	x ## Already in `POSIXct` format
	## [1] "2013-01-24 22:04:14 EST"
	unclass(x)
	## [1] 1359083054
	x$sec
	## Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
	p <- as.POSIXlt(x)
	p$sec
	## [1] 14.37

Finally there is the strptime function in case your dates are written in a different format.

	datestring <- c("January 10, 2012 10:40", "December 9, 2011")
	x <- strptime(datestring, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")
	x
	## [1] "2012-01-10 10:40:00" "2011-12-09 09:10:00"
	class(x)
	## [1] "POSIXlt" "POSIXt"

Check ?strptime for details the formatting strings.


Operations on Dates and Times
-----------------------------

You can use mathematical operations on dates and times. Well really just + and -. you can do comparisons too (_i.e._ ==, <=)

	x <- as.Date("2012-01-01")
	y <- strptime("9 January 2011 11:34:21", "%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S")
	x-y
	## Warning: Incompatible methods ("-.Date",)
	## "-.POSIXt") for "-"
	## Error: non-numeric argument to binary operator
	x <- as.POSIXlt(x)
	x-y
	## Time difference of 356.3 days

Even keep track of leap years, leap seconds, daylight savings, and time zones.

	x <- as.Date("2012-03-01"); y <- as.Date("2012-02-28")
	x-y
	## Time difference of 2 days
	x <- as.POSIXct("2012-10-25 01:00:00")
	y <- as.POSIXct("2012-10-25 06:00:00", tz = "GMT")
	y-x
	## Time difference of 1 hours

Summary
-------

* Dates and times have special classes in R that allow for numerical and statistical calculations
* Dates use the Date class
* Times use the POSIXct and POSIXlt class
* Character strings can be coerced to Date/Time classes using the strptime function or the as.Date, as.POSIXlt, or as.POSIXct functions
