Control Structures - Part 1
===========================

while
-----

While loops begin by testing a condition. If it is true, then they execute the loop body. once the loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, and so forth.

	count <- 0
	while(count < 10) {
		print(count)
		count <- count + 1
	}

While loops can potentially result in infinite loops if not written properly. Use with care!

Sometimes there will be more than one condition in the test.

	z <- 5
	
	while(z >= 3 && z<= 10) {
		print(z)
		coin <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)
		
		if(coin == 1) { ## random walk
			z <- z + 1
		} else {
			z <- z - 1
		}
	}

Conditions are always evaluated from left to right.


repeat
------

repeat initiates an infinite loop; these are not commonly used in statistical applications but they do have their uses. The only way to exit a repeat loops is to call break.

	x0 <- 1
	tol <- 1e-8

	repeat {
		x1 <- computeEstimate()
	
		if(abs(x1 - x0) < tot) {
			break
		} else {
			x0 <- x1
		}
	}

The previous loop is a bit dangerous because there's no guarantee it will stop. Better to set a hard limit on the number of iterations (e.g. using a for loop) and then report whether convergence was achieved or not.


next, return
------------

next is used to skip an iteration of a loop

	for(i in 1:100) {
		if(i <=20) {
			## Skip the first 20 iterations
			next
		}
		## Do something here
	}

return signals that a function should exit and return a given value.


Summary
-------

* Control structures like if, while, and for allow you to control the flow of an R program
* Infinite loops should generally be avoided, even if they are technically correct
* Control structures mentioned here are primarily useful for writing programs; for command-line interactive work, the *apply functions are more useful.
