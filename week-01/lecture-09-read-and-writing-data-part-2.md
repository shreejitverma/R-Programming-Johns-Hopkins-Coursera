Read and Write Data - Part 2
============================

Textual Formats
---------------

* dumping and dputing are useful because the resulting textual format is editable, and in the case of corruption, potentially recoverable
* Unlink writing out a table or CSV file, dump and dput preserve the metadata (sacrificing some readability), so that another user doesn't have to specify it all over again
* Textual formats can work much better with version control programs like subversion and git which can only track changes meaningfully in text files
* Textual formats can be longer-lived; if there is corruption somewhere in the file, it can be easier to fix the problem
* Textual formats adhere to the "Unix philosophy"
* Downside: the format is not very space efficient


dput-ting R Objects
-------------------

Another way to pass data around is by deparsing the R object with dput and reading back using dget.

	> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
	> dput(y)
	structure(list(a =1,
	               b = structure(1L, .Label = "a",
	                             class = "factor")),
	          .Names = c("a", "b"), row.names = c(NA, -1L),
	          class = "data.frame")
	> dput(y, file = "y.R")
	> new.y <- dget("y.R")
	> new.y
	   a  b 
	1  1  a


Dumping R Objects
-----------------

Multiple objects can be deparsed using the dump function and read back in using source.

	> x <- "foo"
	> y <- data.frame(a = 1, b = "a")
	> dump(c("x", "y"), file = "data.R")
	> rm(x, y)
	> source("data.R")
	> y
	  a  b
	1 1  a
	> x
	[1] "foo"


Interfaces to the Outside World
-------------------------------

Data are read in using connection interfaces. Connections can be made to files (most common) or to other more exotic things.

* file, opens a connection to a file
* gzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with gzip
* bzfile, opens a connection to a file compressed with bzip2
* url, opens a connection to a webpage


File Connections
----------------

	> str(file)
	function (description = "", open = "", blocking = TRUE,
	          encoding = getOption("encoding"))

* description is the name of the file
* open is a code indicating
	* "r" read only
	* "w" writing (and initializing a new file)
	* "a" appending
	* "rb", "wb", "ab" reading, writing, or appending in binary mode (Windows)


Connections
-----------

In general, connections are powerful tools that let you navigate files or other external objects. In practice, we often don't need to deal with the connection interface directly.

	> con <-file("foo.txt", "r")
	> data <- read.csv(con)
	> close(con)
	
Is the same as:

	> data <- read.csv("foo.txt")


Reading Lines of a Text File
----------------------------

	> con <- gzfile("words.gz")
	> x <- readLines(con, 10)
	> x
	[1] "1080"     "10-point" "10th"     "11-point"
	[5] "12-point" "16-point" "18-point" "1st"
	[9]	"2"        "20-point" ""

writeLines takes a character vector and writes each element one line at a time to a text file.

readLines can be useful for reading in lines of webpages.

	> ## This might take time
	> con <- url("http://www.jhsph.edu", "r")
	> x <- readLines(con)
	> head(x)
	[1] "<!DOCTYPE html>"
	[2] "<html lang=\"en\">"
	[3] ""
	[4] "<head>"
	[5] "<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />"
	[6] "<title>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</title>"
